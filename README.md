# CalikoLeapTest
A demonstration of using the Caliko inverse kinematics library to visualise Leap hand data.

Leap Motion v2 SDK download: https://developer-archive.leapmotion.com/v2

Note: Linux SDK only contains .deb files for Ubuntu. For Arch Linux, install 'leap-motion-driver' from the AUR: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/leap-motion-driver/

If you're one of my PhD examiners I'm so sorry but I'm running late with this =/

Expected complete July 1st 2019.
